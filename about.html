      <h1>Who I am</h1>
      <p>I’m Arianna. I’m a front end web developer and UX/UI designer from Portland, Oregon. I love to create, problem solve, and ask why. I’m all about growing, challenging myself and lifting up/encouraging those around me. Oh, and my dogs, I’m all about my dogs.</p>

      <h1>What I do</h1>
      <p>I love to design. I favor clean and minimalist websites with gentle and neutral colors with layering that achieve levels of depth. While going to school, I learned about the value of pair programming, I found that we solve problems faster as a pair, and come up with ideas we probably would have never come to on our own. I love Sass/Scss and couldn't imagine coding without it. I have developed skills with Sketch and InVision, as well frameworks in over a variety of languages such as Bootstrap, Angular. In learning about design, I have experience with iconography, color theory, branding, and responsive design. I'm familiar with React and TypeScript and I'm stoked to learn more.</p>
